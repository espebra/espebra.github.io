				Dummy API was originally written in Lua for running on top of OpenResty. Reasons were high performance and simplicity.

This is straight forward, but it adds up - both in time required and extra build dependencies.

				Altibox leverer en hjemmesentral hvor man henter ut TV-signal og internettilgang fra to (eller flere) forskjellige RJ45-porter. Som trådløs router har hjemmesentralen kun et minimum av funksjonalitet, og man skal ikke være en veldig avansert bruker før man vil rekonfigurere hjemmesentralen som en bridge og heller ha en egen trådløs router på baksiden. Dette gir også mening dersom boligen har flere etasjer, og hjemmesentralen ikke er kraftig nok til å levere god nok trådløs dekning.... <a href="/posts/altibox-tv-and-data-over-the-same-ethernet-cable/">read more</a>

A bright reader, Jeff, came up with an alternative method. This alternative method does not involve dd’ing the image into a loop device, but instead copying the contents of the disk image directly into tmpfs.

				KVM and Xen provide a method to change the amount of memory in use by guests at runtime. The method is called memory ballooning [1, 2], and it must be supported by the guest operating system to work.
In libvirt, memory allocation (and hence the ballooning capability) for a guest can be configured using the memory, currentMemory and memballoon tags:
&lt;domain type=&#39;kvm&#39;&gt; [...] &lt;memory unit=&#39;KiB&#39;&gt;16777216&lt;/memory&gt; &lt;currentMemory unit=&#39;KiB&#39;&gt;1048576&lt;/currentMemory&gt; [...] &lt;devices&gt; &lt;memballoon model=&#39;virtio&#39;/&gt; &lt;/devices&gt; &lt;/domain&gt; The guest can never use more memory than specified in the memory tag and it is the amount of memory the guest will use at boot time.... <a href="/posts/memory-ballooning/">read more</a>
