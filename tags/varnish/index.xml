      <description>This post was first published at High Scalability.
Varnish Software has just released Varnish API Engine, a high performance HTTP API Gateway which handles authentication, authorization and throttling all built on top of Varnish Cache. The Varnish API Engine can easily extend your current set of APIs with a uniform access control layer that has built in caching abilities for high volume read operations, and it provides real-time metrics.
Varnish API Engine is built using well known components like memcached, SQLite and most importantly Varnish Cache.</description>
