      <description>Several years ago I wrote a series of posts on how to run EL6 with its root filesystem on tmpfs. This post is a continuation of that series, and explains step by step how to run CentOS 7 with its root filesystem in memory. It should apply to RHEL, Ubuntu, Debian and other Linux distributions as well. The post is a bit terse to focus on the concept, and several of the steps have potential for improvements.</description>

      <description>Background I&amp;rsquo;ve got balanced ventilation in my apartment. It works OK, but I don&amp;rsquo;t fully understand how it behaves if knobs are pushed and pots are turned, and I&amp;rsquo;m definitely not sure if its performance is as good as I should expect.
I&amp;rsquo;m going to do some measurements to see how the system reacts to changes in the outside temperature and tuning of the various settings. The first parameter to measure is the temperature in the air intake, exhaust air and some of the ventilation valves in the different rooms in the apartment.</description>

      <title>CentOS/RHEL/SL 6: root filesystem on tmpfs, UPDATE #2</title>

      <description>Update 2017-06-30: Please see the updated guide which is more generic.
In a previous post, I’ve explained how to boot EL6 from memory without having / needing a physical disk.
A bright reader, Jeff, came up with an alternative method. This alternative method does not involve dd’ing the image into a loop device, but instead copying the contents of the disk image directly into tmpfs. The result is higher write/read performance and generally lower memory requirements.</description>

In EL6.4, the file /usr/share/dracut/modules.d/90dmsquash-live/dmsquash-live-root was updated so that the previous patch no longer works as it should. I’ve updated the patch, and here it is:

UPDATE: The patch below has been updated here.
There are several scenarios where conventional hard drives are not really needed. Examples are HPC cluster nodes, virtualization nodes, home theater streaming PCs, silent desktops, internet cafés and embedded systems. Hard drives tend to fail, they are slow, they consume power, they generate heat and noise, and they are quite expensive if you need/want something faster and more reliable than SATA.</description>
