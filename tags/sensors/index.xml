      <description>Background I&amp;rsquo;ve got balanced ventilation in my apartment. It works OK, but I don&amp;rsquo;t fully understand how it behaves if knobs are pushed and pots are turned, and I&amp;rsquo;m definitely not sure if its performance is as good as I should expect.
I&amp;rsquo;m going to do some measurements to see how the system reacts to changes in the outside temperature and tuning of the various settings. The first parameter to measure is the temperature in the air intake, exhaust air and some of the ventilation valves in the different rooms in the apartment.</description>
